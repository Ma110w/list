When in Titan sight, a lock-on is established and won't be broken until the Titan sees another player.
Titans infinitely pathfind and try to face where their locked-on player's x, y, z coordinates are.
After a Titan stomps, they lose the ability to stomp for approximately 5 seconds.
Stomping can be avoided by jumping just before their foot hits the ground.
You can acquire the ability 'Butcher' to hit two different body parts during a slice.
You can also acquire the ability 'Carnifex' to hit four different body parts during a slice.
